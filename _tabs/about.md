Hello, I'm Mark Visser, a Site Reliability Engineer based in the Netherlands with a deep passion for observability and building reliable, scalable systems.

Throughout my career, Iâ€™ve worked with organizations such as De Nederlandsche Bank, Ahold Delhaize, Pandora Intelligence, and ProRail. Each reinforcing my belief that observability is not just a toolset, but a mindset.

I'm currently the Lead Observability Engineer at [Nedap](https://nedap.com){:target="_blank"}, where we build mission-driven software solutions for sectors like healthcare, security, and retail, empowering organizations through smarter technology.
